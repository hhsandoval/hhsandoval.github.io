1. [Differential Impact of COVID-19 on the Energy Consumption of Residential and Business Sectors](http://www.iaee.org/eeep/article/451)  
   with Pedro Hancevic. *Economics of Energy & Environmental Policy, 12(1), 2023.* <button class="block" onclick="myFunction('paper1');"> [Show/Hide Abstract] </button>   
   <div id="paper1" style="display:none;"> <p style="font-size:90%;"> <b>Abstract:</b> As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, some patterns of energy consumption changed in the residential and non-residential sectors. This paper uses data from a local utility company in Florida to quantify the heterogeneous impacts of the pandemic on electricity and natural gas consumption across households from different income levels and across essential and non-essential businesses. We found significant increases in the average residential electricity consumption during the lockdown and subsequent reopening phases, which translate into higher cost for households. We found that natural gas consumption dropped abruptly in the business sector and also important differences between the electricity consumption of essential and non-essential businesses, with the former consuming more and the latter less electricity.</p> </div>

2. [The Impacts of Fare-Free Bus Programs on Educational Outcomes of K-12 Students](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/721376)
   with Emanuel Garcia Munoz. *Journal of Human Capital, 16(4), 2022.* <button class="block" onclick="myFunction('paper2');"> [Show/Hide Abstract] </button>   
   <div id="paper2" style="display:none;"> <p style="font-size:90%;"> <b>Abstract:</b> With the increasing difficulty in providing student transportation, school districts have increased their collaboration with public transit providers to offer access to public transportation through free or reduced-fare programs. One such program was implemented in Florida, allowing any K-12 student in Leon County to ride the bus for free at any time to any destination. This paper applies the synthetic control method to estimate the impact of this program on school attendance and chronic absenteeism. Surprisingly, our results show negative impacts on both attendance and absenteeism outcomes, highlighting the potential unintended consequences of programs with no restriction on student ridership.</p> </div>

3. [Low Income Energy Efficiency Programs and Energy Consumption](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2022.102656)
   with Pedro Hancevic. *Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, Vol 113, 102656, 2022* <button class="block" onclick="myFunction('paper3');"> [Show/Hide Abstract] </button>   
   <div id="paper3" style="display:none;"> <p style="font-size:90%;"> <b>Abstract:</b> Low-income energy efficiency programs have become a major component of cities' energy policy, with 49 out of 51 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. offering one. This paper uses data from Gainesville Regional Utility to quantify the impacts of the housing investment done by its Low-income Energy Efficiency Program Plus (LEEP Plus) on energy consumption. Our results show that LEEP Plus does not affect natural gas consumption but reduces electricity consumption by approximately 7%, with greater savings occurring in the summer and winter. The effect on electricity consumption is significant to a variety of robustness checks and remains for at least 24 months after the completion of energy efficiency upgrades. We also measure some relevant heterogeneous effects, one of which is the breakdown of the air-conditioning-related investments, the main energy efficiency improvement under the LEEP Plus program. Finally, we evaluate the energy savings in monetary terms considering the private cost changes and the social cost changes. In both cases, the associated energy savings are not enough to offset the investment costs.</p> </div>
  
4. [The Role of Consumer Confidence in Forecasting Consumption, Evidence from Florida](https://doi.org/10.1002/soej.12528)
   with Anita Walsh. *Southern Economic Journal, 88(2): 757-788, 2021* <button class="block" onclick="myFunction('paper4');"> [Show/Hide Abstract] </button>   
   <div id="paper4" style="display:none;"> <p style="font-size:90%;"> <b>Abstract:</b> Consumers’ attitudes about the direction of the economy influence their decisions about discretionary purchases, saving, and investment. This paper uses data from Florida’s consumer sentiment index to study the role and accuracy of consumer confidence in forecasting consumption, as well as the mechanism behind such a relationship. Spending on durable goods tends to be more discretionary in nature and it is frequently done using credit, thus potentially more sensitive to changes in consumer attitudes. Our results indicate that the in-sample predictive power of the index and its questions is limited to predicting spending on durable goods, particularly, on autos. Furthermore, consumer confidence does not improve the out-of-sample forecast beyond the forecast from a baseline model, which considers economic fundamentals. Finally, the evidence shows that the relationship between shocks in consumer confidence and economic activity arises because confidence measures contain information about the state of the economy, thus rejecting animal spirits.</p> </div>

5. [Social Capital in Labor Market Access and Poverty in Mexico](http://biblioteca.ciess.org/adiss/r458/social_capital_in_labor_market_access_and_poverty_in_mexico)
  with Martin Lima. *Well-being and Social Policy, 9(1): 49-71, 2014* <button class="block" onclick="myFunction('paper5');"> [Show/Hide Abstract] </button>   
   <div id="paper5" style="display:none;"> <p style="font-size:90%;"> <b>Abstract:</b> Social capital, defined as the set of social networks that a person has in order to obtain benefits, is used by the population as a mechanism for providing resources, to cushion shocks in consumption and to obtain information on available employment opportunities. This study employs a logistic model to characterize the manner in which people access the labor market in Mexico through the use of their social networks (bonding social capital). It also takes poverty levels into account. A cycle in the use of social networks was observed in which job searches are initially conducted with the help of family, then friends and co-workers, and, lastly, neighbors. This cycle is robust in the case of the poor, who rely primarily on friends and co-workers to enter the labor market.</p> </div>

6. [Negative Net Incomes and the Measurement of Poverty: A Note](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ega/rafega/200903.html)
   with Carlos Urzúa. *Journal of Management, Finance, and Economics, 3(1): 29-36, 2009* <button class="block" onclick="myFunction('paper6');"> [Show/Hide Abstract] </button>   
   <div id="paper6" style="display:none;"> <p style="font-size:90%;"> <b>Abstract:</b> This note warns about the careless computation of poverty indexes when the welfare of each household is measured by its net income, since this can be negative. As is illustrated in the case of Mexico, even if only a handful of households report negative incomes, the resulting poverty aggregates, when they go beyond a mere headcount measure, can behave rather badly. The note ends with suggestions on how to deal with the problem.</p> </div>

7. [TIPs for the Analysis of Poverty in Mexico, 1992-2005](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ega/rafega/200806.html)
   with Carlos Urzúa and Alejandra Macías. *Journal of Management, Finance, and Economics, 2(1): 74-91, 2008* <button class="block" onclick="myFunction('paper7');"> [Show/Hide Abstract] </button>   
   <div id="paper7" style="display:none;"> <p style="font-size:90%;"> <b>Abstract:</b> This paper proposes some changes to the official methodology that is currently in use to measure the state of poverty in Mexico. Among other suggestions, it is recommended the use of bootstrapping to estimate confidence intervals for the poverty statistics, as well as the use of dominance analysis when making intertemporal comparisons. In particular, since poverty lines change over time, the paper proposes the use of TIP curves for that end. Using the eight surveys that were made during the period 1992-2005, the paper presents a large number of absolute poverty statistics and TIP curves, as well as comparisons among them.</p> </div>

1. [Sentiments and Spending Intentions: Evidence from Florida](https://hhsandoval.github.io/CSI2022.pdf)  
   with Anita Walsh *(under review)* <button class="block" onclick="myFunction('wpaper1');"> [Show/Hide Abstract] </button>   
   <div id="wpaper1" style="display:none;"> <p style="font-size:90%;"> <b>Abstract:</b> Consumer sentiment is considered an important leading indicator of changes in household spending. However, the overall empirical evidence of the causal relationship between sentiment and consumption is mixed and scarce. We address these gaps by employing data from the monthly Florida Consumer Attitude Survey, which captures party affiliation, consumer sentiment, and spending intentions at the individual level since 1991. We employ political partisanship around elections in which the governing party changed as an instrument for sentiment. Our results show that party affiliation is a strong instrument that has a positive and statistically significant effect on sentiment. Moreover, we find a statistically significant causal relationship between sentiment and spending intentions. This effect is sizable and robust across the presidential elections in our sample as well as to a variety of robustness checks. Finally, we provide evidence that spending intentions relate to actual spending, and show that spending increased more among counties with a larger share of Republican voters following the 2016 presidential election.</p> </div>

2. [Social Interactions and Social Divisions in Program Intervention](https://hhsandoval.github.io/SI2022.pdf) 
   *(under review)* <button class="block" onclick="myFunction('wpaper2');"> [Show/Hide Abstract] </button>  
   <div id="wpaper2" style="display:none;"> <p style="font-size:90%;"> <b>Abstract:</b> Using micro-level data from the conditional cash transfer program Progresa in Mexico, this paper estimates a behavioral model of school attendance and social interactions to study how social divisions due to program targeting can affect the complementarities arising from social interactions as well as their subsequent effects on program outcomes. The qualitative evaluation of the program indicated that social divisions manifested between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries as a result of the program’s targeting. However, the empirical evidence suggests that the distinction introduced by the program between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries did not alter the endogenous-effects network and therefore the complementarities. The evidence is consistent with a positive spillover program effect on school attendance and an endogenous effect accounting for 25 percent of the overall treatment effect.</p> </div>
